## 📊 Project 1: Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel & Pivot Tables)

This project showcases the ability to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence using standard analytical tools.

### 1. The Business Problem
The sales team relied on manual and delayed monthly reports, hindering timely performance tracking and management decisions. A solution was needed to provide daily, reliable access to key performance indicators (KPIs).

### 2. The Solution (Analyst Role)
I developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard in **Excel**, utilizing **Pivot Tables** and various formulas (VLOOKUP, etc.) to aggregate and structure the raw sales data.

* **Files:** `Sales_Dashboard.xlsx - DATA.csv` (Raw Sales Transactions) and `Sales_Dashboard.xlsx - PIVOT TABLES.csv` (Aggregated Data).
* **Methodology:** Structured the raw transactional data into meaningful summaries by city, product category, and sales representative.

### 3. Key Insights & Action
* **Insight:** Identified that while **Mumbai** generates the highest total revenue, **Delhi** shows the fastest growth rate month-over-month.
* **Recommendation:** Recommended reallocating marketing resources toward faster-growing regions like Delhi, and focusing sales training on maximizing units-per-order in high-revenue cities like Mumbai.

⚙️ Project 2: Financial Reporting Automation (Power Query & Power Pivot)
This project highlights end-to-end proficiency in data pipeline creation, transformation, and business analysis, demonstrating a full solution lifecycle.

1. The Business Scenario (The Problem)
An urgent request was received from the VP of Sales for a new regional sales report, but the required data was highly fragmented, residing across multiple sources: SQL servers, CSV files, and static PDFs. The task was to deliver a complex, interactive report by the next business day.

2. The Action (The Solution)
I used Power Query (ETL) to extract, transform, and load the data from all external sources. This automation was followed by advanced analysis:

Building a relational model using Power Pivot to join the tables without manual formulas.

Conducting exploratory analysis and defining calculated measures with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

Designing a simple, interactive report using Pivot Charts and Slicers.

3. Key Insight & Impact
Insight: The analysis revealed [Insert a specific finding based on the category/time data from PROJ2_Powerqery.xlsx, e.g., "A direct correlation between the 'Computers' product category and the highest monthly revenue spikes was identified, confirming where the strategic focus should be."].

Impact: The solution delivered a complex, integrated report within the tight deadline, proving the ability to handle fragmented data sources and provide rapid, high-level business intelligence when under pressure.

4. Skills Showcased
Power Query (ETL), Power Pivot, DAX, Relational Modeling, Urgent Stakeholder Reporting, and Data Transformation.
